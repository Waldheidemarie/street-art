# Street Art

It is an app that helps street artists to start to make money. 

What to do?
If you are a street artist, just create an account on our platform and post a picture that you want to draw. Wait certain days for donations to your art. If the donated money is enough for you, then start to make your art on a random wall that you found. When you have done, send us a picture of art and choose coordinates on the map where you draw that picture. After our proof that you really made that art, your bank account will be fulfilled with donated money. Good luck and have fun 
😁
